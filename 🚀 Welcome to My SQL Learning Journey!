These projects, focused on designing store databases and employee data, mark the beginning of my SQL proficiency development.

Key Features:
Project Focus: The projects primarily revolve around creating and querying databases, with an emphasis on practical applications.

Skill Improvement: With each project, my goal is to enhance my understanding of SQL concepts and improve my ability to design efficient and effective databases.

Learning in Progress: Consider this repository as a snapshot of my learning process. I'm open to feedback and suggestions as I evolve in my SQL journey.
